# Tabs to Accordion

Hi, Iâ€™m @muhammadameensheikh

Using HTML & CSS, with the help of flexbox, I have created tabs which change to accordion in mobile devices. You can switch between the tab content and in mobile the tabs are stacked on top of each other and function just like an accordion.

No javascript has been used. This is achieved using only HTML & CSS
